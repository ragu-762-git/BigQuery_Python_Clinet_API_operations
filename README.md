# BigQuery_Python_Clinet_API_operations
This repository contains python files where each file contains individual operations such as creating a dataset, table and loading batch data into BigQuery using the Bigquery Client API library written in python.

# Objective 
The objective of this repo is to learn how to do all operations in Bigquery starting from creating a dataset & table and loading data into the table (overwriting the table, append data to the table) and run SQL queries in the BigQuery Client API in Python itself. 

# note 
Before running the scripts in the cloud shell, make sure the dataset and table are present in the BQ and if not, create the dataset, table and load the bacth data.
